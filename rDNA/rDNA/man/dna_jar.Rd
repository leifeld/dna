  version, including full path.

\description{
Identify and/or download and install the correct DNA jar file.
}
\details{
rDNA requires the installation of a DNA jar file to run properly. While it is
possible to store the jar file in the respective working directory, it is
preferable to install it in the rDNA library installation directory under
\code{inst/java/}. The \code{dna_jar} function attempts to find the version
of the jar file that matches the installed \pkg{rDNA} version in the
\code{inst/java/} sub-directory of the package library path and return the
jar file name including its full path. If this fails, it will try to find the
jar file in the current working directory and return its file name. If this
fails as well, it will attempt to download the matching jar file from GitHub
and store it in the library path and return its file name. If this fails, it
will attempt to store the downloaded jar file in the working directory and
return its file name. If this fails as well, it will clone the current DNA
master code from GitHub to a local temporary directory, build the jar file
from source, and attempt to store the built jar file in the library path or,
if this fails, in the working directory and return the file name of the jar
file. If all of this fails, an error message is thrown.
